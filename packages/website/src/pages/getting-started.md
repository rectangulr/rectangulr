# Getting Started

## Online playground

The simplest way to get started is to use the [online editor](./playground.html) (Stackblitz).

## Local development

Clone the `starter` package directly from github.

```sh
# Clone the starter app
npx degit rectangulr/rectangulr/packages/starter my-app

# Setup
cd my-app
npm install
npm run build

# Start the app
node rg/main.mjs
```
